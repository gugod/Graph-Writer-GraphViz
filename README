    Graph::Writer::GraphViz - GraphViz Writer for Graph object

SYNOPSIS

      my @v = qw/Alice Bob Crude Dr/;
      my $g = Graph->new(@v);
    
      my $wr = Graph::Writer::GraphViz->new(-format => 'dot');
      $wr->write_graph($g,'/tmp/graph.simple.dot');
    
      my $wr_png = Graph::Writer::GraphViz->new(-format => 'png');
      $wr_png->write_graph($g,'/tmp/graph.simple.png');
    
      Graph::Writer::GraphViz->new(
            -format => 'png',
            -layout => 'twopi',
            -ranksep => 1.5,
            -fontsize => 8
            -edge_color => 'grey',
            -node_color => 'black',
           )->write_graph($g,'/tmp/graph.png');

DESCRIPTION

    Graph::Writer::GraphViz is a class for writing out a Graph object with
    GraphViz module. All GraphViz formats should be supported without a
    problem.

METHODS

 new()

    Unlike other Graph::Writer modules, this module provide an extra
    parameter '-format' to new() method, in order to save different format.
    Other supported GraphViz parameters are -layout, -ranksep, -shape,
    -fontsize, -arrowsize. Please see the SYNOPSIS for example usage.

    Valid format depends on those GraphViz as_fmt methods on your system,
    like, 'gif' if you have 'as_gif', 'text' if you can do 'as_text'.
